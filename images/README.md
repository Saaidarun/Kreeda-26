# How to Add Your Logo Files

## Steps to Complete the Logo Setup

You need to save your logo images to the `images` folder. Here's how:

### 1. Save the College Logo
- **File name:** `college-logo.png`
- **Location:** `c:\Users\saaid\Music\sports day\images\college-logo.png`
- **Image:** The blue shield logo with "DISCIPLINE HARD WORK SUCCESS"

### 2. Save the KR Logo
- **File name:** `kr-logo.png`
- **Location:** `c:\Users\saaid\Music\sports day\images\kr-logo.png`
- **Image:** The blue "KR" logo

## How to Save the Images

### Option 1: Save from your files
1. If you have the logo files on your computer, copy them to the `images` folder
2. Rename them to `college-logo.png` and `kr-logo.png`

### Option 2: Download from the web
1. Right-click on each logo image
2. Select "Save image as..."
3. Navigate to `c:\Users\saaid\Music\sports day\images\`
4. Save with the correct filename

### Option 3: Use image editing software
1. Open the logo images in Paint or any image editor
2. Save them as PNG files with the correct names
3. Place them in the `images` folder

## Verify the Setup

After saving the logos, open `index.html` in your browser. You should see:
- **College logo** on the left side of the navigation bar
- **"Sports Day 2026"** text in the center
- **KR logo** next to "Sports Day 2026" text
- Both logos should have a subtle scale effect when you hover over them
